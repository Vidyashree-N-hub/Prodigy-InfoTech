#Task 3 Password Complexity Checker

A password complexity checker is a tool or feature that evaluates the strength of a password based on certain criteria. It helps users create strong passwords that are less susceptible to attacks, such as brute force or dictionary attacks. Here are the main aspects of a password complexity checker:

Key Features
Length Requirement:

Enforces a minimum password length (commonly at least 8 characters).
Encourages longer passwords for added security.
Character Variety:

Checks for the inclusion of different character types:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %)
Common Patterns:

Identifies and discourages common passwords or easily guessable patterns (like "password," "123456," or keyboard patterns like "qwerty").
Dictionary Checks:

Compares the password against a list of common words or phrases to prevent the use of easily guessable passwords.
Entropy Calculation:

Estimates the randomness or unpredictability of a password, often measured in bits. Higher entropy indicates a stronger password.
User Feedback:

Provides real-time feedback as users create their passwords, indicating whether the password is strong, medium, or weak.
Breach Check:

Some checkers can verify if a password has previously been compromised in data breaches by cross-referencing against known leaked passwords.
