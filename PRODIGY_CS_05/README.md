#Task 05  Network packet analyzer

A network packet analyzer, often called a packet sniffer, is a tool used to capture and analyze packets of data traveling over a network. These tools can help troubleshoot network issues, monitor traffic, and ensure security by analyzing the contents of data packets.

Some popular network packet analyzers include:

Wireshark: A widely used open-source tool that allows you to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.

tcpdump: A command-line packet analyzer that provides powerful filtering capabilities and can capture packets in real-time.

SolarWinds Packet Sniffer: A commercial solution that offers detailed analysis and visualization of network traffic.

Fiddler: Primarily used for web traffic, it can inspect HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses.

Nmap: While primarily a network scanner, it has capabilities for packet capture and analysis as well.

Key Features to Look For:
Real-time capturing: Ability to capture packets as they happen.
Filtering: Options to filter packets based on protocols, IP addresses, or other criteria.
Visualization: Graphical representation of data for easier analysis.
Decoding: Ability to decode various protocols and display the contents in a human-readable format.
Exporting: Options to export captured data for further analysis or reporting.
Use Cases:
Network Troubleshooting: Identify issues such as slow performance or connectivity problems.
Security Analysis: Detect suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
Protocol Development: Analyze and debug custom protocols or applications.
