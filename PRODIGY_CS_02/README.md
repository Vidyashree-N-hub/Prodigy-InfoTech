#Task 02 pixel manipulation for image encryption

Pixel manipulation for image encryption involves altering the pixel values of an image in a way that obscures its original content, making it unreadable without the proper decryption method. Here are some key concepts and techniques related to this process:

Key Concepts
Pixel Representation: Images are typically represented as a grid of pixels, where each pixel has color values (e.g., RGB values). Manipulating these values is central to image encryption.

Encryption Algorithms: Common algorithms include symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) and asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA). For image encryption, symmetric methods are often preferred due to their efficiency.

Confusion and Diffusion:

Confusion: Makes the relationship between the key and the ciphertext complex, often achieved by rearranging pixel values.
Diffusion: Ensures that changing one pixel affects many others, spreading the influence of the key.
Techniques
Pixel Shuffling: Rearranging the order of pixels based on a pseudorandom key. This keeps the pixel values intact but changes their positions.

Value Transformation: Applying mathematical transformations to pixel values. Common methods include:

XOR Operation: XORing pixel values with a key.
Addition/Subtraction: Adding or subtracting a key value from pixel values.
Bit-level Manipulation: Altering specific bits within the pixel values to introduce changes without significantly altering the image's overall appearance.

Image Dithering: Techniques like Floyd-Steinberg dithering can be used to obscure image details, contributing to encryption.

Chaos-based Encryption: Utilizing chaotic systems (e.g., logistic maps) to generate keys and perform pixel-level operations, offering high sensitivity to initial conditions.

Steps in Image Encryption
Key Generation: Generate a secret key that will be used for the encryption and decryption process.

Pixel Manipulation: Apply chosen techniques (shuffling, transformation) to the pixel values using the key.

Output: Produce an encrypted image that appears random and does not resemble the original.

Decryption Process
The decryption process involves reversing the steps taken during encryption, using the same key to restore the original pixel values and positions.
